# sdtt-py: Simple Detection Theory Tool
This is a Python implementation of the R package 'sdtt'.

## Overview
The primary functionality of sdtt-py allows users to calculate various detection theory measures. At present, the sensitivity measure *d'* and the response bias measures criterion location (*c*), relative criterion location (*c'*), and likelihood ratio ($$\beta$$) are implemented. Additional utilities are included allowing users to determine outcomes (hits, misses, correct rejections, false alarms) from raw (binary) data, as well as calculation of proportions for each outcome.
